# A timed typing test in C.

Using time.h structs + functionality. Dev tools: vim, gdb. Environment: linux.


SCOPE OF THE GAME :
Time the user on how long it takes user to *correctly* type in 9 words, which
are randomly given to user.

RULES :

1: The user has an infinite amount of time to type in each word correctly.

2: The 9 words appear at random (all permutations are possible).

3: Each word appears only once.

4: The user has an infinite number of attempts to type in each word correctly.

5: Case sensitive.

6: Tell the user how long the game took them.

7: Tell the user if they're wrong.

8: Typescript the Terminal session.


Final note: I'm a Mr T fan, as you will see in the user interaction flow.
